# TAS

Project redhead: Total Resilience for The Machine.

This is a system for creating applications built using the Stencils for TxHPC framweworks, for shared access to Gen-Z-style byte addressable shared memory across nodes (as in The Machine).

To use this code run the following commands. :high_brightness:

```bash
cd bin
cmake ../.
make
./run_applications %APPLICATION_TYPE %ITERATION_SIZE %OPTIONAL_GRIDSIZE

#To plot the graph (Activate X11, gnuplot must be installed (I use VM45))
gnuplot Script_%APPLICATION_Name --persist
```

APPLICATION_TYPE:
* jf = Jacobi Iteration
* gf = GameOfLife
* gf_computation = GameOfLife With More Computation
* sm = SparseMatrix
* ac = AccessTimes
* jf_scale = Jacobi Iteration Scaling Up to 1TB

%ITERATION_SIZE
* 1
* 100
* 1000 (Everything above will take too much time.)

%OPTIONAL_GRIDSIZE
Use this parameter if application jf_scale was chosen to set the gridsize: (Use the right numbers)
* 1GB = 11 180
* 10GB = 35356
* 100GB = 111 804
* 250GB = 176776
* 500GB = 250 000
* 1000TB = 353 553
